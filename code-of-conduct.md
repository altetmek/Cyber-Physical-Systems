### How do we plan to collaborate?

1. For non-sprint meetings, they are planned ahead of time, at least 24hrs before the expected meeting will take place, to ensure that every group member has the opportunity to arrange time, or give prior “heads up” they will be late/absent.
2. Conduct coding sessions with a pair-programming fashion.
3. Use kanban practices with GitLab issue boards to trace and keep track of group work.
   - integrate GitLab board into GitLab issues.
4. Use scrum practices in combination with GitLab issue boards, refer to pair programming.
   - Weekly sprints with sprint planning, report and retrospective.
   * The dates for this shall be discussed further, and changes may apply.

### How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

1. Using a pair programming style.
2. Alter the pair periodically every two weeks during sprint meetings.,
3. Having regular meetings where we update each other about the progress.

### How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

1. By using the scrum meetings mentioned, we shall have an “updating each other & issues” period.
2. Everybody has to be up to date and active with the GitLab Issue boards which should ensure at least a general overview of what is going on.

### What is our usual communication plan?

1. The team will be using Discord as their main VoIP software. Furthermore when peer programming zoom will be utilized, as the screen sharing quality is higher.
2. Meetings will be planned and pinned within the shared group calendar on canvas.

### How will we solve conflicts?

1. We embrace the conflict rather than pretending it didn't happen to avoid building more tension. We will deal with the aroused issues as soon as possible.
2. We talk to each other and give all the members time to talk and explain their point of view.
3. We give full attention to the person who is talking and making sure that their message has been received.
4. After hearing the disagreements from all parties and discussing them among the team, we put the effort and focus on the positives rather than the negatives and move towards a mutual agreement.
5. Since flipping a coin would lead to poor decisions and would not be applicable for most of the cases, we will be using a voting system where members will vote for the idea they support. In case of even number of votes the discussion shall continue until a vote is passed.
6. Everyone has a room to express their opinions. Therefore, all members will have a fair chance to discuss and support their ideas and prove them worthy and useful. It is the responsibility of every team member to make sure everybody has the opportunity to raise their concerns, and is accounted for in terms of being encouraged to understand the possible final decision.
7. As soon as a group member spots an imminent conflict, it is their responsibility to encourage the conflicting party to raise their voice of concern.
